# 🟧 Illini Portal Fit Engine

**A data-driven transfer-portal recruiting target board for Illinois Men's Basketball.**

Built for the Illinois Men's Basketball Analytics Internship. It profiles Illinois's roster,
detects what's leaving, and ranks every eligible Division I player by a transparent **Fit
Score** so the staff can walk into the portal window with a shortlist instead of a blank page.

- **Write-up:** [`report/writeup.md`](report/writeup.md)
- **Data:** 100% public, from [BartTorvik](https://barttorvik.com)

## What it does

1. **Reads Illinois's identity from data**: record, Barthag, adjusted offense/defense, tempo
   (2025-26: 28-9, #6 Barthag, **#2 offense**, slow #289 tempo → an *elite half-court* team).
2. **Detects roster needs**: assumes seniors graduate (editable), then measures the share of
   last year's shooting / playmaking / defense / rebounding that's walking out the door.
3. **Scores every eligible D-I player** on a 0-100 **Fit Score** = a weighted, fully visible
   blend of **Production + Role fit + System fit + Attainability**, each percentile-ranked
   within the realistic candidate pool.
4. **Lets the staff drive**: tune weights, edit departures, re-weight needs, filter by
   conference/position/class, and export the board to CSV, all live.

### Beyond the score: a full scouting suite

- **Big Ten Translation:** projects every candidate's raw box line to *Illinois's level*,
  calibrated on 990 real cross-season transfers (matched by stable player id). It learns from
  data that efficiency and made-shooting travel while raw volume deflates, so a 21-ppg SWAC
  scorer shows as ~6.5 ppg in the Big Ten, with a Keep% and a level-jump risk label.
- **Outcome-backed precedents:** for any target, the real historical transfers who started
  from a similar profile and made a similar-size level jump, with what actually happened to
  their scoring and an empirical kept-% band. That's the named evidence behind the projection.
- **Development trajectories:** tracks the same player across seasons to flag genuine risers
  and breakouts (a bigger role that held efficiency) that a single-season line hides.
- **Player comps:** z-scored style vectors plus nearest-neighbor search. Turn a departing
  Illini into a ranked list of transfer-eligible look-alikes, and tag every target with its
  closest high-major comps.
- **Head-to-head compare:** overlay 2–3 targets' percentile radars, Fit components, and
  projected lines on one screen to settle *which* of the top names to chase.
- **Post-portal depth chart:** project the roster after departures, see the open Guard / Wing /
  Big spots, and slot board targets into the holes.
- **Visual scouting cards:** a percentile radar vs the Big Ten, the raw→projected line, a
  shot diet, and comps, exportable to a printable one-page PDF per target.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd illini-portal-fit
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app loads instantly from the committed data snapshot in `data/raw/`. Click
**🔄 Refresh from BartTorvik** in the sidebar to pull fresh data.

### Run the pipeline / tests without the UI

```bash
python -m illini_fit.fetch        # download + validate data (asserts Illinois parses)
python -m illini_fit.fit_score    # print the default Illinois board + run sanity checks
python -m illini_fit.translation  # calibrate the Big Ten retention model on real transfers
python -m illini_fit.precedent    # real comparable transfers + kept-% band for a target
python -m illini_fit.trajectory   # multi-year risers / breakouts across Division I
python -m illini_fit.similarity   # style replacements for a departing Illini + target comps
python -m illini_fit.scouting     # write a sample 1-page scouting-card PDF to report/
```

## How the Fit Score is built

| Component | Weight (default) | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Production** | 35% | BPM, porpag, minutes load (proven value) |
| **Role fit** | 20% | Does the player's position fill a *depleted* Illinois spot? |
| **System fit** | 35% | Strengths matched to the *specific* skills Illinois must replace |
| **Attainability** | 10% | Realism, from current team strength (`High-major proven` → `Low-major standout`) |

Weights, departures, and need priorities are all adjustable in the app.

## Data sources

| Source | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Player advanced stats | `https://barttorvik.com/getadvstats.php?year=YYYY&csv=1` |
| Team ratings | `https://barttorvik.com/YYYY_team_results.json` |

I reverse-engineered the column layout of the headerless player feed and validated it
(shooting splits reconcile; `BPM == OBPM + DBPM` and `TRB == ORB + DRB` hold for 100% of
rows). Unverified columns go unused.

## Deploy a live link (Streamlit Community Cloud, free)

1. Push this repo to GitHub (public).
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) → **New app**.
3. Pick the repo, branch `main`, main file `streamlit_app.py`.
4. Deploy. Paste the resulting URL into the **Live app** field above.

## Notes & limitations

Portal availability isn't a clean public feed, so the engine ranks the full eligible pool and
is meant to be filtered to the live portal list. It uses one season of box-score data (no
NIL/cost, no play-type data). Defaults are a sensible starting point, and the sliders exist so
the staff owns the final weighting. See [`report/writeup.md`](report/writeup.md) for the full
discussion.
